# Mapping_the_Susceptibility_to_Forest_Fires_using_ARCMAP
The objective of this project is to create a forest fire susceptibility map of the Aveiro Region that can be used as input for the analysis of the best location for new watchtowers and the detection of the optimal paths for fire trucks in case of emergency for the most vulnerable areas. Once the study area is defined in the first part of the project, we will collect all the data needed to perform this analysis. Having done this, it will be possible to characterize the study area by different perspectives to have a better understanding of the study domain. This will be followed by defining the criteria and weights needed to construct the susceptibility map. After that, we will use the necessary data and the criteria and weights to construct the susceptibility map. Once the map is defined, it will be possible to study the optimal location of the watchtowers in relation to the vulnerable areas that are not yet covered by the existing ones and to calculate the optimal paths for the fire trucks to reach the most susceptible area of the region as quickly as possible.
